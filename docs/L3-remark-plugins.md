# Remark Plugin Pipeline

Three remark plugins process content during the Astro build: `remarkCallout`, `remarkTodo`, and `remarkWikilink`. They are registered in `astro.config.ts` and run in array order before rehype (standard unified pipeline).

## Plugin registration

The same plugin array appears in two places in `astro.config.ts`:

```typescript
integrations: [
  mdx({
    remarkPlugins: [remarkCallout, remarkTodo, remarkWikilink],
  }),
],
markdown: {
  remarkPlugins: [remarkCallout, remarkTodo, remarkWikilink],
},
```

Both are needed because Astro treats `.md` and `.mdx` files as separate pipelines. `markdown.remarkPlugins` applies to `.md` files. `mdx.remarkPlugins` applies to `.mdx` files. Without both, one format would get raw, untransformed text. In practice this site only uses `.mdx`, but the `markdown` block also holds `shikiConfig`, and keeping the plugin lists identical avoids surprises if `.md` files are added later.

## remarkCallout

External plugin from `@r4ai/remark-callout`. Transforms Obsidian-style blockquote callouts into structured HTML with `data-callout` attributes.

Input syntax:

```markdown
> [!note] Optional title
> Body text here.
```

Supported callout types (styled in `components.css` via `[data-callout-type]`):

- `note`, `info` -- accent color border
- `tip`, `hint`, `important` -- success color border
- `warning`, `caution`, `attention` -- warning color border
- `danger`, `error`, `bug` -- error color border
- `quote`, `cite` -- transparent background, italic

The plugin outputs elements with `data-callout`, `data-callout-title`, and `data-callout-body` attributes. Styling lives in `src/styles/components.css`.

## remarkTodo

Custom plugin (`src/lib/remark-todo.ts`). Converts inline TODO markers into styled HTML spans.

Input syntax: `[TODO::label text]` or `[TODO::]` (label is optional).

Regex: `/\[TODO::([^\]]*)\]/g`

The plugin visits every `text` node in the mdast tree. When it finds a match, it splits the text node into a sequence of `text` and `html` nodes, then splices them into the parent's children array in place. This is a destructive operation on the AST -- the original text node is replaced.

Output HTML for `[TODO::fix this]`:

```html
<span class="todo-marker" role="note">
  <span class="todo-label">TODO</span> fix this
</span>
```

Output HTML for `[TODO::]` (empty label):

```html
<span class="todo-marker" role="note">
  <span class="todo-label">TODO</span>
</span>
```

The `role="note"` attribute provides accessibility semantics. Visual styling (dashed warning-colored border, highlighted background) is defined in `src/styles/components.css` under `.todo-marker` and `.todo-label`.

## remarkWikilink

Custom plugin (`src/lib/remark-wikilink.ts`). Converts wikilink syntax into anchor tags.

Regex: `/(?:(\w+)::)?\[\[([^\]|]+)(?:\|([^\]]+))?\]\]/g`

Supported forms:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `[[my-page]]` | `<a href="/my-page/">my-page</a>` |
| `[[my-page\|display text]]` | `<a href="/my-page/">display text</a>` |
| `[[index]]` | `<a href="/">index</a>` |
| `type::[[my-page]]` | `<a href="/my-page/">my-page</a>` (type captured but unused) |

The `index` slug is special-cased to produce `/` instead of `/index/`, matching the routing convention in `src/pages/index.astro`.

The optional `type::` prefix (capture group 1) is parsed but currently discarded in the HTML output. It exists to support typed relations (e.g., `parent::[[slug]]`) if the feature is extended later.

Uses the same AST transformation pattern as `remarkTodo`: visit text nodes, split on matches, splice replacement nodes.

## Processing order

Plugins run in array order: callout first, then todo, then wikilink. Since `remarkCallout` transforms blockquote nodes (not text nodes), it doesn't interfere with the two text-node plugins. `remarkTodo` and `remarkWikilink` both visit text nodes and splice replacements, but their regex patterns don't overlap (`[TODO::...]` vs `[[...]]`), so ordering between them doesn't matter in practice. If a text node contained both patterns, whichever runs first would split the node, and the second would need to visit the resulting fragments. The current order handles this correctly because `parent.children.splice()` inserts new nodes that the tree walker will still visit.

After remark plugins finish, the unified pipeline runs rehype (HTML processing). Shiki code highlighting happens at the rehype stage.

## Shiki code highlighting

Configured under `markdown.shikiConfig` with the `github-light` theme. Shiki processes fenced code blocks (triple-backtick) into syntax-highlighted HTML. The theme applies to both `.md` and `.mdx` files.

The MDX integration inherits `shikiConfig` from the `markdown` block automatically -- it does not need to be specified separately.

## Edge cases

**MDX component boundaries.** Remark plugins operate on the mdast (Markdown AST). Content inside imported MDX components (e.g., `<MyComponent>text</MyComponent>`) is parsed as JSX, not as markdown text nodes. The custom plugins will not transform `[TODO::...]` or `[[...]]` syntax that appears inside JSX component tags. The syntax must appear in regular markdown flow content to be processed.

**Multiple matches in one text node.** Both custom plugins handle multiple matches per node correctly. They iterate all regex matches, build an array of interleaved text/html children, and splice them in a single operation.

**Empty/whitespace labels.** `remarkTodo` trims the label (`match[1].trim()`). An empty label like `[TODO::]` produces a span with just the "TODO" badge and no trailing text.

**Wikilink slugs with spaces.** The wikilink regex captures everything between `[[` and `]]` (or `|`), trims it, and uses it directly in the `href`. Slugs with spaces would produce URLs with spaces, which is likely unintended. Content should use hyphenated slugs.
